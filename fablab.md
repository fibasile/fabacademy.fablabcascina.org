## Getting there

Lab Address:

Via Mario Giuntini 25 int.28
Cascina (Pisa)

Lotto B Scala C Primo Piano

**By train**: Train station Navacchio on the line between Pisa and Firenze. Not all trains stop here so watch out. FabLab is outside the train station.

**By car**: Superstrada Firenze-Pisa-Livorno, "Navacchio - Visignano" exit 


## Where to sleep

The Fab Lab is located in Navacchio, which is more a commercial / residential area, and there isn't much night life around.

If you are ok with that there are several convenient places where to sleep.

**Foresterie c/o Polo Tecnologico**

Located inside the same technological park hosting the FabLab, 4 Mini apartments with Wifi, Kitchen, Air Conditioning, etc. At very good rates.
Contact Fiore for availability / booking.

**Hotels in Pisa** 

If you want to visit the city during the night and have access to bars and restaurants, you can pick one of the many hotels in Pisa.

I recommend one which is located behind the main street and few hundred meters away from the main train station.

From there you can get a regional train to the Fab Lab, make sure it stops in **Navacchio** station.
