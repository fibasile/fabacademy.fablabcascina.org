#### Key concepts

Version Control Software has been around for a while. It is really important for software development, but can help a lot i.e. also for writing books,
managing websites, etc.

The important concepts of version control are:

- along with files we keep their **version history**, so we can revert each file if we need to
- we keep track of **diffs**, so we know which lines of each file have changed
- we can **merge** different versions of each file, so we can edit two different parts and then join them in a new version
- we can **branch** a project, creating a new working copy of it and then merge back our changes, or not
- each time we want to make a snapshot of our files creating a new version we **commit** changes.
- versioning is usually done on a local computer, or on a remote server, which we call **repository**
- we **pull** files from a repository
- we **push** changes to a repository
- if many users make changes to the same files in the same lines there is a **merge conflict**
- we **resolve** conflicts by:
  - a) taking changes from one user or another and discarding the rest 
  - b) manually editing the file and committing again a new version 

####Git and Mercurial

Many VC software exist, the most popular are Subversion, **Mercurial** and **GIT**.

Each has his strength and weaknesses. The most used worldwide is GIT. The one we used till now in Fab Academy is Mercurial. You should know both.

**Difference between Git and Mercurial** 

>*Git is MacGyver and Mercurial is James Bond*

**Git is distributed** VCS, every user has is own private local repository then each user merges changes into a main repository, usually via pull-requests.

**Mercurial is centralized**, every user *pulls* a copy of the repository on the local computer, then *pushes changes* to a central repository. If anybody changed files in the meanwhile, one needs first to resolve any *conflicts*.

</div>

Which one is better? Up to you to decide.

####Introducing Git

**Getting the software**

Download GIT for [OSX](http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list?can=3), [Windows](http://msysgit.github.io/), [Linux](http://git-scm.com/downloads)

**Creating a (local) repository**

Create a folder into your computer, cd into it and run git init

	mkdir testing-git
	cd testing-git
	git init
	
You will get 
	
	Initialized empty Git repository in /private/tmp/repo/.git/
	
**Add some files to the repository and commit them**

Create a README file with some text into your repository folder, then

	git add README
	git commit -m 'Initial import'
	
You will get

	[master (root-commit) 1bcaa4d] initial import
	 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
	 create mode 100644 README

**NOTE** the file is committed to your local repository so you made a snapshot of it

Now you can edit it again, and look if something changed:

	git status
	
You will get

	On branch master
	Changes not staged for commit:
	  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
	  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

		modified:   README
		
You will see that this file has been changed since last commit. To see what actually changed you can run:

	git diff
	
getting

	diff --git a/README b/README
	index 9daeafb..2219bed 100644
	--- a/README
	+++ b/README
	@@ -1 +1,2 @@
	-test
	+test is a test
	+test2
	
At this point you can either commit your changes with **git add** and **git commit** as above, or discard them. To discard changes

	git checkout -- README
	
will roll README back to the committed version.

**Branching**

Eventually you might need to work on some changes for a long time. And maybe you're not sure these changes should make it into the main version of your repository.
Consider you want to add a feature to your software but are not sure of it.

This is the perfect scenario for using a **branch**. When you create a repository the branch you're using is called **master**. 

You can create a new branch i.e. *new_feature* using:

	git branch new_feature

And list what is your current branch using

	git branch
	
In our case we'll get:

	git branch
	* master
	  new_feature

Meaning we are currentyl using **master**. To access the *new_feature*

	git checkout new_feature
	
Getting

	Switched to branch 'new_feature'
	
Now we can make edits in the new branch, and commit them without affecting files in master.
Edit the README, add and commit some changes to it. Then switch back to the master branch.
You can easily import the changes you made into the "new_feature" branch using the merge command.

	git merge new_feature

You will get:
	
	Updating 1bcaa4d..27efb70
	Fast-forward
	 README | 3 +++
	 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)

Now the master branch will have all the changes you made in the other branch. Each time you want to sync the two you can merge changes this way.

**Remote repositories**

The cool thing about Git is that it works not only locally but also via Internet. We can use it without a server. But we can also use it on **remote
repositories** to collaborate with other people and keep our data safe.

You can install Git on any internet server. Most of people use the [GitHub](http://github.com) service as a repository for open source projects.

Let's now register an account to GitHub and create a new repository on it. The we can add it as a **remote** for our local git project. We can have
many different remote repository for our project, each with a symbolic name. In our case we use the *origin* name. 

	git remote add origin https://github.com/fibasile/repo.git
	
The last link is the one GitHub gives you for your new repository.
You can use different transport mechanism for talking with remote repository HTTP, SSH, etc. More on this in the [GitHub help](http://help.github.com).

At this point we can send our project branch to this remote, we **push** 

	git push origin master
	
Once the branch has been pushed, other people or we ourselves can get a copy of the repository for local edits. This is called **cloning**.
Go into another folder on your computer, and write:

	git clone https://github.com/fibasile/repo.git
	
This will create a local copy where you can work, edit files, commit changes and so on. Once you did that, you can **push** again your changes.
Now go back to the original folder. In order to synchronize with the changes you made just now, you now **pull** the remote repository.

	git pull origin master
	
Now both of your local folders are in sync. This is also a very convenient way of keeping folders synchronized among different computers.

####Introducing Mercurial

**Getting the software**

You can download Mercurial for [Windows](http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/download/index.html), [OSX](http://mercurial.selenic.com/downloads), [Linux](http://mercurial.selenic.com/downloads).

**Getting started**

As with Git we can work on a local folder and enable it for versioning. 

The basic tool for Mercurial is called **hg**, taking the name from the chemical symbol of mercury. Typing hg on his own gets us the list of supported commands.

	hg
	Mercurial Distributed SCM

	basic commands:

	 add           add the specified files on the next commit
	 annotate      show changeset information by line for each file
	 clone         make a copy of an existing repository
	 commit        commit the specified files or all outstanding changes
	 diff          diff repository (or selected files)
	 export        dump the header and diffs for one or more changesets
	 forget        forget the specified files on the next commit
	 init          create a new repository in the given directory
	 log           show revision history of entire repository or files
	 merge         merge working directory with another revision
	 pull          pull changes from the specified source
	 push          push changes to the specified destination
	 remove        remove the specified files on the next commit
	 serve         start stand-alone webserver
	 status        show changed files in the working directory
	 summary       summarize working directory state
	 update        update working directory (or switch revisions)

	use "hg help" for the full list of commands or "hg -v" for details

We can now create a folder and init it as a Mercurial repository

	hg init
	
Now go on and create a new README with some text, then add it to the repository and commit the change.

	hg add README
	hg commit -m 'Initial import' -u fiore
	
Note you need to specify a user name on the commit line. You can setup a default one with **hg config --edit**
Now we can check everything is fine, checking the mercurial log which shows the history of changes committed to the repository

	hg log

We'll get

	changeset:   0:a2f0ef1e4c12
	tag:         tip
	user:        fiore
	date:        Wed Jan 14 13:52:23 2015 +0100
	summary:     Initial import
	
Now try and edit the README file adding some text. Next step is committing it. First difference with git is that we don't need to add README before running the commit. As long as we don't add/remove any file, Mercurial will know what has changed since last commit. This is convenient, as long as you want to commit every file you changed!!

	hg commit -m 'Another edit'
	
Checking the log again we know that all is fine:

	changeset:   1:6d8acdcc1429
	tag:         tip
	user:        fiore
	date:        Wed Jan 14 13:57:20 2015 +0100
	summary:     Some text added

	changeset:   0:a2f0ef1e4c12
	user:        fiore
	date:        Wed Jan 14 13:52:23 2015 +0100
	summary:     Initial import
	
Now imagine we add a new file to the repository. Let's create a LICENSE file with some text. Then check the status of the folder:

	hg status
	? LICENSE

If we simply commit the file will stay there.

	hg commit -m 'another commit'
	nothing changed

We need to add the file to the versioning system. Just once, then Mercurial will track it's changes forever. There's a convenient command you should use for this. 

	hg addremove 
	adding LICENSE
	hg commit -m 'another commit'
		
This will take care of both adding any new file and removing any delete file from the current version. For instance if you want to remvoe the README, you simply delete it and run addremove and commit again

	rm README 
 	hg addremove
	removing README

Mercurial has a cool feature you can go back and forth in version history. For example we can go back to the first version committed

	hg update -r0
	1 files updated, 0 files merged, 1 files removed, 0 files unresolved
	
Where 0 in this case is the first **changeset**, you can see the number with *hg log*. If you don't specify any value for update you will get back to the latest version.

#### Remote repositories

As with Git we can work with other people with Mercurial. We do this by using a remote repository.

One popular online service offering Mercurial Hosting is [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org). You can register a free account there and create a new Mercurial repository. Make sure you check the Mercurial checkbox for repository type.

Once you are ready you can push your current local repository to the new remote one:

	hg push https://fibasile@bitbucket.org/fibasile/testrepo
	
This will load the project on the bitbucket repository, but Mercurial won't remember the repository url and you would have to type it each time.
You can fix this creating a file into the hg folder **.hg/hgrc** containing

	[paths]
	default = https://fibasile@bitbucket.org/fibasile/testrepo

You can set all kind of options into this file, documentation on the hgrc is available [here](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/hgrc.5.html)

Same as we did with Git we can **clone** the repository in another folder and makes changes to it simulating some other collaborator working on the project:

	  cd new_folder
	  hg clone https://fibasile@bitbucket.org/fibasile/testrepo
	  
Now let's edit the LICENSE and add a new README with some text. Then run *hg addremove* and *hg commit* on them. Then push the changes on the remote repos.

	hg addremove
	hg commit -m 'Added new README and updated LICENSE'
	hg push
	
This time we don't need to update the hgrc since we cloned the repository from the remote one. In fact there's already an hgrc in the .hg folder!

#### Fixing conflicts

Now we can pull the changes into our previous folder. But first let's edit the LICENSE again deleting all the contents, so we can see what happens if there's a conflict. In the initial folder:

	hg addremove
	hg commit -m 'Removed LICENSE text'
	hg push
	
We get something like

	pushing to https://fibasile@bitbucket.org/fibasile/testrepo
	warning: bitbucket.org certificate with fingerprint 45:ad:ae:1a:cf:0e:73:47:06:07:e0:88:f5:cc:10:e5:fa:1c:f7:99 not verified (check hostfingerprints or web.cacerts config setting)
	searching for changes
	remote has heads on branch 'default' that are not known locally: 4c3851b23038
	abort: push creates new remote head 7f93695a6e1f!
	(pull and merge or see "hg help push" for details about pushing new heads)

Every time this happens, **READ CAREFULLY WHAT MERCURIAL SAYS, OR YOU WILL BE IN TROUBLE**.

In particular the line 

	abort: push creates new remote head 7f93695a6e1f!
	
Means we are creating a new branch head, and we DON'T want this, as other people will ignore it and delete all our changes. 

Luckily Mercurial gives us some hint on how to proceed:

	(pull and merge or see "hg help push" for details about pushing new heads)

So we do what he tells us:

	hg pull
	
Getting

	pulling from https://fibasile@bitbucket.org/fibasile/testrepo
	searching for changes
	adding changesets
	adding manifests
	adding file changes
	added 1 changesets with 2 changes to 2 files (+1 heads)
	(run 'hg heads' to see heads, 'hg merge' to merge)
	
Then we can merge, and commit. Please notice that we MUST commit and push again our merged version in order to bring back order to the repository.

	hg merge
	hg commit -m 'Merged my changes'
	hg push
	
In most cases if we edited different files there should be no further action. Otherwise we might have to solve the merge manually with some tool.

At the end you can check the log to see what happened:

	changeset:   6:61f4b120ec71
	tag:         tip
	parent:      4:7f93695a6e1f
	parent:      5:4c3851b23038
	user:        fiore
	date:        Wed Jan 14 14:57:11 2015 +0100
	summary:     merging my changes

Here you notice that the latest changeset has two different **parents**, each created during the last two pushes to the repository.
